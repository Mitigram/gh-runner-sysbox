            Automatic release to match new GH Actions runner [release]. See all
            versions and pull instructions [here][images]. Main generated GHCR
            image called `${{ needs.runner.outputs.image }}`.

            This image also exists without the git sha suffix, i.e. with only the
            SemVer of the runner release as a tag: `${{ steps.semver.outputs.version }}`.
